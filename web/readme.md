This is a todo app which uses the todo-backend API to store its todos.

# Provenance

This app is a slightly-modified version of the [TodoMVC Architecture Example for for backbone.js](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/backbone/js).

Forked from https://github.com/TodoBackend/todo-backend-client to containerize and add Cloud Build job to deploy.
